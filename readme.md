###Introduction

Zippy is a quick shell script I made that will quickly zip files and place them on the desktop. See `zippy -h` for more information.

###Usage

By default, zippy will zip the contents of all files in the current directory, and place it on the desktop, named `archive.zip`.

**Enjoy!**
